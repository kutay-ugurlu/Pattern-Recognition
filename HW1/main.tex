\section*{Q1}

Nearest Neighbor and Classification Tree classifiers overfit to data, \textit{i.e.} they memorized the training data and are more prone to making errors in the
future classifications. On the other hand,  Discriminant Analysis and Na\"ive Bayesian approaches are better in terms of generalizing, \textit{i.e.} making inferences 
from already available training data.
